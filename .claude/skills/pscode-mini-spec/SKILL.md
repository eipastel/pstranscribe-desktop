# Mini Spec

Write or revise `brief.md` — short, simple, approvable.

## Format

```
# <change name>
## Objective
One or two sentences.
## Expected behavior
- item
## Out of scope
- item
```

## Rules

- Plain language; no unnecessary jargon.
- Separate **objective**, **expected behavior** and **out of scope**.
- Respect `limits.max_brief_lines` (`pscode/config.yaml`). If you exceed it, trim.
- When done, **stop and ask for approval** — via `AskUserQuestion` (`Sim` / `Não`,
  recommended first), never as plain prose.
