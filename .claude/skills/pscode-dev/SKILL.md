# Dev

Build a **refined** change (Ready to Dev) by walking it across the board, one
subtask at a time. You commit directly to the current
branch — there is no PR.

## How to act

### 1. Claim the card (if `pscode/github.yaml` exists)

Use `pscode-github-sync`:
- **Move the card → In Development** (`in_progress`) *and* **assign the user** —
  the assign does not replace the status move; run both and confirm it landed.
  Work directly on the current branch — no PR is opened.

### 2. Gather context before coding

`refine.md` is the plan, but the card is the source of truth and may have moved
on since refinement. Before writing code, read:
- `refine.md` (summary, technical detail, scope, `## Subtasks`).
- If `pscode/github.yaml` exists, the **Issue description + comments** via
  `pscode-github-sync` (`gh issue view <issue> --repo <repo> --comments`), plus
  each **sub-issue's body and comments** — new discussion may add constraints,
  clarify a subtask, or shift scope.
Fold anything new into your understanding. If it conflicts with `refine.md` or
expands scope, **stop and ask the user** rather than guessing.

### 3. Implement subtask by subtask

Use `pscode-task-runner` against `refine.md`'s `## Subtasks`:
- Take the **first unchecked** subtask, implement only that, show a short diff.
- Run the relevant validation and report the result.
- Ask before ticking it `[x]` — through `AskUserQuestion` as a `Sim` / `Não`
  choice (recommended first), e.g. "Subtask done. Marco `[x]` e fecho a
  sub-issue #N?". After ticking, **close the matching sub-issue** on the card
  (via `pscode-github-sync`) so its progress bar stays accurate.
- Repeat. **Never expand scope mid-subtask.**

### 4. Code review gate

When all subtasks are done **and the project builds and its tests pass** — run
the project's own build/test commands (e.g. the scripts in its package manifest
or Makefile); don't assume a specific tool:
- Move the card → **In Code
  Review** (`review`) via `pscode-github-sync`.

### 5. Test, then Ready to Deploy

- With the user's approval (ask via `AskUserQuestion`, `Sim` / `Não`), move the
  card → **In Test** (`in_test`).
- Once the user confirms it is **working** (again via `AskUserQuestion`), move the
  card → **Ready to Deploy** (`ready_to_deploy`), then post the **next-step
  comment** (`/ps:complete <card#>` in a fenced block) via `pscode-github-sync`.

## Golden rule

One subtask at a time, always with human validation (`apply_mode` +
`approval_required` in `pscode/config.yaml`). Each gate above **moves the card** —
confirm every move landed, never leave it behind. `gh` calls
are non-blocking only on failure, never optional.
