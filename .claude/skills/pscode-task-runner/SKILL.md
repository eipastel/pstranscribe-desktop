# Task Runner

Implement **only the next pending subtask** in `refine.md` (the `## Subtasks`
checklist). This is the implementation loop inside `/ps:dev`.

## How to act

1. Read `brief.md` and `refine.md`.
2. Take the **first** unchecked subtask (`- [ ]`) under `## Subtasks`.
3. Implement only that subtask. **Don't expand the scope.**
4. Show a short diff of what changed.
5. Run the relevant validation (tests/lint), if possible, and report the result.
6. Ask whether you can mark the subtask as done (`- [x]`) — put it through
   `AskUserQuestion` as a `Sim` / `Não` choice (recommended first), never as plain
   prose.

Respect `apply_mode: one_task_at_a_time` and `approval_required` in
`pscode/config.yaml`. One task at a time, always with human validation — every
"can I proceed?" goes through `AskUserQuestion`.
