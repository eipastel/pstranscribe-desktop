# Complete

Close out a change and keep the history tidy. Two paths share this skill:
**complete** (delivered → Done) and **cancel** (dropped → Cancelled). Both
**archive** the change and sync the board. Always **confirm before archiving** —
ask via `AskUserQuestion` (`Sim` / `Não`, recommended first), never as plain prose.

## Complete path (`/ps:complete`)

1. Confirm the work is done: no unchecked `## Subtasks` remain in `refine.md`.
2. Write a short **delta spec** at `pscode/changes/<slug>/delta-spec.md` —
   openspec-style but lean. Capture only what the spec/behavior changed:

   ```
   # <change name> — Delta
   ## Added
   - new behavior / requirement
   ## Changed
   - behavior that changed (old → new)
   ## Removed
   - behavior dropped
   ```

   Keep it to one screen; omit empty sections.
3. **Archive**: move `pscode/changes/<slug>/` to
   `pscode/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/` (use today's date).
4. If `pscode/github.yaml` exists, use `pscode-github-sync`: **move the card →
   Done** (`done`) and confirm it landed, comment the conclusion, then **close**
   the Issue.

## Cancel path (`/ps:cancel`)

1. Ask the user for the **reason** to cancel — via `AskUserQuestion`, offering a
   few common reasons (e.g. `Obsoleto`, `Duplicado`, `Fora de escopo`) plus the
   free-text field. No delta spec is written.
2. **Archive** the change to `pscode/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`.
3. If `pscode/github.yaml` exists, use `pscode-github-sync`: **move the card →
   Cancelled** (`cancelled`) and confirm it landed, comment the reason, then
   **close** the Issue.

## Golden rule

Confirm before archiving (via `AskUserQuestion`) — never archive automatically. `gh` calls are
non-blocking only on failure, never optional: always *attempt* the status move,
and if the sync fails, archive locally and report what to finish by hand.
