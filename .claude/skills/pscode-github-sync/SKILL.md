# GitHub Sync

Keep the change's **GitHub Issue + Project board** in sync with the flow.
Run this from the steps that change state. **Conditional, not optional**: it acts
whenever `pscode/github.yaml` exists, and then you run *every* action the step
prescribes — assign, **move the card**, comment. "Non-blocking" means **tolerate
failure, never skip the work**: always *attempt* each `gh` call; only if one fails
(no `gh`, no auth, no network) do you report it and continue the flow.

## Guard (do this first, every time)

1. If `pscode/github.yaml` does **not** exist → do nothing, silently.
2. Read it. Use `gh` from its `gh:` field (default `gh`). The values you need:
   `repo`, `owner`, `project`, `projectNodeId`, `statusFieldId`, `statuses`
   (a stage → option-id map), `issuePattern`, `links`.
3. (Optional) Read `pscode/requirements.yaml` to confirm `gh auth` is in place.

## Resolve the Issue for a change (deterministic order)

1. `links["<slug>"]` in `github.yaml`, else
2. the number in `pscode/changes/<slug>/.issue`, else
3. derive `<issuePattern>-NN` from the slug (`issuePattern: none` disables this).

If none resolves and the step is `/ps:draft`, **create** the Issue (below).
Every command also accepts the **card number directly** — when the user passes
one, use it instead of resolving.

## Stage map (flow step → board column → `statuses` key)

| Step             | Board column    | Stage key         | Also |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| `/ps:draft`      | Backlog         | `backlog`         | create Issue (body = the short draft), add to Project |
| `/ps:refine` (in)| In Refinement   | `proposed`        | **assign user** |
| `/ps:refine` (out)| Ready to Dev   | `ready_to_dev`    | **create a sub-issue per subtask**, update Issue body from `refine.md` |
| `/ps:dev` (start)| In Development  | `in_progress`     | **assign user** |
| `/ps:dev` (subtask)| —             | —                 | on each subtask `[x]`, **close its sub-issue** |
| `/ps:dev` (review)| In Code Review | `review`          | — |
| `/ps:dev` (test) | In Test         | `in_test`         | — |
| `/ps:dev` (deploy)| Ready to Deploy| `ready_to_deploy` | — |
| `/ps:complete`   | Done            | `done`            | comment, then **close** the Issue |
| `/ps:cancel`     | Cancelled       | `cancelled`       | comment reason, then **close** the Issue |

If `statuses.<stage>` is absent (the Project lacks that option), skip the move
and tell the user to run `/ps:board-setup`.

## Next-step comment (post on every successful move that has a next step)

After the card lands in its new column, **comment the command that drives the
next step** so the user just copies it to continue. Post the command **inside a
fenced code block** — GitHub renders a one-click copy button — with a short line
above it. Always substitute the real Issue number for `<card#>`. Map:

| Card now in (step that just ran) | Comment to post        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Backlog (`/ps:draft`)            | `/ps:refine <card#>`   |
| Ready to Dev (`/ps:refine`)      | `/ps:dev <card#>`      |
| Ready to Deploy (`/ps:dev`)      | `/ps:complete <card#>` |
| Done (`/ps:complete`)            | — terminal, no comment |
| Cancelled (`/ps:cancel`)         | — terminal, no comment |

The intermediate `/ps:dev` moves (In Code Review, In Test) have **no** next-step
comment — only **Ready to Deploy** unlocks `/ps:complete`. The comment body is a
short line plus the command on its own line wrapped in a triple-backtick fenced
block. For a card that just reached Backlog as Issue 42, the comment's Markdown
is the line `Próximo passo — refine este card:` followed by a fenced block
containing only `/ps:refine 42`, so the rendered comment shows it with a copy
button. Pass that whole body to `gh issue comment` (heredoc or `--body-file`
to keep the fences intact). This comment is
part of the move's prescribed work, governed by the same "non-blocking only on
failure" rule — always attempt it after confirming the move landed.

## Commands

**Create the Issue (`/ps:draft`):** the short draft description is the Issue
body — there is **no `brief.md`** at draft time, so pass it inline (a heredoc or
`--body-file -` keeps the line breaks). The title follows the
`[<type>] <description>` pattern (type ∈ `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`,
`docs`, `chore`):
```bash
gh issue create --repo <repo> --title "[<type>] <description>" --body "<short draft>"
```
Capture the printed URL, extract its number, add it to the board and set
`backlog`. The local change folder and `.issue` are **not** written here — that
happens in `/ps:refine`.

**Assign the current user (`/ps:refine`, `/ps:dev`):**
```bash
gh issue edit <issue> --repo <repo> --add-assignee @me
```

**Read the Issue (description + comments)** — input for `/ps:refine`:
```bash
gh issue view <issue> --repo <repo> --comments
```

**Update the Issue body (`/ps:refine`):**
```bash
gh issue edit <issue> --repo <repo> --body-file pscode/changes/<slug>/refine.md
```

**Create sub-issues for the subtasks (`/ps:refine`, on approval):** turn each
`## Subtasks` item in `refine.md` into a **native sub-issue** of the card, so the
board shows the breakdown and a progress bar. **Idempotent** — list the existing
sub-issues first and skip any title already there:
```bash
# titles already linked (match on these to avoid duplicates)
gh api repos/<repo>/issues/<issue>/sub_issues --jq '.[].title'
# for each NEW subtask line:
url=$(gh issue create --repo <repo> --title "<subtask text>" \
  --body "Sub-issue of #<issue>")
child=${url##*/}                                  # issue number from the URL
id=$(gh api repos/<repo>/issues/$child --jq .id)  # its integer (database) id
gh api --method POST repos/<repo>/issues/<issue>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=$id
```
Keep the `## Subtasks` checklist in the local `refine.md`, but **drop it from the
posted Issue body** — the sub-issues replace it. If the sub-issues API isn't
available (older GitHub), fall back to leaving the checklist in the body.

**Close a subtask's sub-issue (`/ps:dev`, when a subtask is ticked `[x]`):** keep
the card's progress bar honest by closing the matching sub-issue.
```bash
gh issue close <childNumber> --repo <repo>
```

**Add to the Project (returns the item id):**
```bash
gh project item-add <project> --owner <owner> --url <issueUrl> --format json
```

**Set the board status (the core action — never skip it).** It takes two `gh`
calls: first find the Project **item id** for the Issue, then edit its Status.
Run *both* every time the stage map says to move the card:
```bash
# 1. item id for this Issue (raise --limit if the board is large)
gh project item-list <project> --owner <owner> --format json --limit 200
# → pick the item whose .content.number == <issue> → its .id
# 2. set the Status field to the stage's option id
gh project item-edit --id <itemId> --field-id <statusFieldId> \
  --project-id <projectNodeId> --single-select-option-id <statuses.<stage>>
```
Parse the JSON to pick the item: **don't assume `jq` exists** (many environments
lack it) — pipe to whatever the project already uses (e.g. `node -e`), or use
`gh`'s built-in `--jq`/`-q` flag. **If step 1 finds no item** (e.g. the Issue was
never added to the board, so the list is empty or lacks it), the Issue isn't on
the Project yet — run `item-add` (above) to get its id, *then* edit. An empty
`--id` makes `item-edit` fail with "Could not resolve to a node"; never call it
with a blank id. After editing, **confirm the move landed** (re-run step 1 and
check the item's Status) before reporting the step done. A successful `assign`
does **not** stand in for the status move — both must run.

**Comment:**
```bash
gh issue comment <issue> --repo <repo> --body "<short note>"
```

**Close (`/ps:complete`, `/ps:cancel`, after the move + comment):**
```bash
gh issue close <issue> --repo <repo>
```

## Golden rule

"Non-blocking" governs **failure**, not effort: always *attempt* every action the
step prescribes — the **status move is the whole point**, never skip it just
because it costs two commands or the `assign` already ran. If `gh` is missing,
unauthenticated, or the repo has no remote, say how to fix it (`gh auth login`,
etc.) and **continue the flow** — the guided steps never depend on the sync
succeeding.
