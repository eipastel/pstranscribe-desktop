# /ps:draft

Take a natural-language request and register it as a card in the **Backlog** —
nothing more. No analysis, no code, **and no `brief.md`**: structuring the change
is `/ps:refine`'s job. The draft only gets the idea onto the board.

Use the **pscode-guided-sdd** skill (draft step).

1. Understand the request well enough to name it. **Infer a `<type>`** from the
   request — one of `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore` — and
   **confirm it via `AskUserQuestion`** (recommended option first). From the type
   plus a short natural-language description, build the **card title** as
   `[<type>] <description>` (e.g. `[feat] padrão de título para cards`) and the
   internal **slug** as `<type>-<description-in-kebab-case>` (e.g.
   `feat-padrao-titulo-card`). The slug names the `pscode/changes/<slug>/` folder.
2. Draft a **short description** — objective plus a line on expected behavior and
   what's out of scope. A few lines, not a spec.
3. **Stop and ask for validation** of the title and that description — via
   `AskUserQuestion` (`Sim` / `Não`, recommended first), never as plain prose.

Do not ask the Grill Me questions, do not write a `brief.md`, and do not write
code here.

## Register the card

**With GitHub (`pscode/github.yaml` exists):** use the **pscode-github-sync**
skill — create the Issue with that short description as its **body**, add it to
the Project, **set status Backlog** (confirm it landed). No local files are
created here; the Issue *is* the draft (the change folder and `.issue` are
written later, by `/ps:refine`). Then post the **next-step comment**
(`/ps:refine <card#>` in a fenced block). Non-blocking only on `gh` failure.

**Without GitHub:** there is nowhere to register the card, so fall back to a
local record — create `pscode/changes/<slug>/` and save the short description as
a minimal `brief.md`. This is the only case where `/ps:draft` writes a file.
