# /ps:cancel <card#>

Drop a change that won't be delivered. Accepts the board **card/issue number**
(e.g. `/ps:cancel 42`); otherwise resolve from the slug.

Use the **pscode-complete** skill (cancel path).

1. Ask the user for the **reason** to cancel — via `AskUserQuestion`, offering a
   few common reasons (e.g. `Obsoleto`, `Duplicado`, `Fora de escopo`) plus the
   free-text field.
2. **Archive** the change: move `pscode/changes/<slug>/` to
   `pscode/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`.
3. **Stop and confirm** before archiving — ask via `AskUserQuestion` (`Sim` /
   `Não`, recommended first).

## GitHub sync (if `pscode/github.yaml` exists)

Use the **pscode-github-sync** skill: **move the card → Cancelled**
(`cancelled`) and confirm the move landed, comment the reason, then **close** the
Issue. Non-blocking only on `gh` failure.
