# /ps:refine <card#>

Refine a drafted change into a clear, **standardized, issue-ready** document.
Accepts the board **card/issue number** for direct reference (e.g.
`/ps:refine 42`); otherwise resolve the change from its slug.

Use the **pscode-refine** skill.

## Claim the card first (if `pscode/github.yaml` exists)

Use the **pscode-github-sync** skill: **assign the current user** to the Issue
**and move the card → In Refinement** (`proposed`). Both actions — the assign
does not replace the status move; confirm the move landed. Non-blocking only on
`gh` failure.

## Then refine

1. **Set up the change and write the brief.** The draft now lives on the card,
   not in a file. Resolve the slug (Issue title in kebab-case), create
   `pscode/changes/<slug>/`, and save the card number to `.issue`. Turn the
   **Issue description** (the draft) into `brief.md` (objective, expected
   behavior, out of scope). If a local `brief.md` already exists (no-GitHub
   draft), use it as-is.
2. Gather context before refining:
   - Read `brief.md`.
   - Read `questions.md`: fold in answered questions, note any still open.
   - **Analyze the code** the change will touch, so the refinement is grounded.
   - If `pscode/github.yaml` exists, read the Issue **description + comments**
     via **pscode-github-sync** — recent discussion may add or cut scope.
3. Run the **Grill Me** logic (skill `pscode-grill-me`) to close blocking
   ambiguities — at most 5 questions.
4. Write `refine.md` in the standard format: lean summary, technical detail,
   in/out of scope, and a **`## Subtasks`** checklist (the unit `/ps:dev` runs).

Do not write production code in this step. **Stop and ask for approval** — via
`AskUserQuestion` (offer the `Está refinada` answer first), never as plain prose.

## On approval (if `pscode/github.yaml` exists)

Use the **pscode-github-sync** skill, in order: **create one native sub-issue per
`## Subtasks` item** linked to the card; update the Issue body from `refine.md`
(omitting the `## Subtasks` checklist — it's now sub-issues); then **move the
card → Ready to Dev** (`ready_to_dev`) and confirm the move landed; finally post
the **next-step comment** (`/ps:dev <card#>` in a fenced block). Non-blocking
only on `gh` failure.
