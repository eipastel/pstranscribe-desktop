# /ps:complete <card#>

Finalize a change once it is Ready to Deploy. Accepts the board **card/issue
number** (e.g. `/ps:complete 42`); otherwise resolve from the slug.

Use the **pscode-complete** skill.

1. Confirm the work is done: no unchecked `## Subtasks` in `refine.md`.
2. Write a short **delta spec** (`delta-spec.md`) — openspec-style but lean:
   what behavior/spec was Added, Changed or Removed. Keep it to one screen.
3. **Archive** the change: move `pscode/changes/<slug>/` to
   `pscode/changes/archive/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/`.
4. **Stop and confirm** before archiving — ask via `AskUserQuestion` (`Sim` /
   `Não`, recommended first); don't archive automatically.

## GitHub sync (if `pscode/github.yaml` exists)

Use the **pscode-github-sync** skill: **move the card → Done** (`done`) and
confirm the move landed, comment the conclusion, then **close** the Issue.
Non-blocking only on `gh` failure.
