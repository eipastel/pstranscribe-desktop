## PSCode — Guided SDD

This project uses **PSCode**: a guided, spec-driven flow installed into your
coding agent. Every change moves through short, human-validated steps and lives
under `pscode/changes/<slug>/`.

**Flow (mirrors the board):** `/ps:draft` (Backlog) → `/ps:refine <card#>` (In
Refinement → Ready to Dev) → `/ps:dev <card#>` (In Development → In Code Review →
In Test → Ready to Deploy) → `/ps:complete <card#>` (Done). `/ps:cancel <card#>`
sends a card to Cancelled.

**Rules (non-negotiable):**
- Prefer the `AskUserQuestion` tool for any question — at every step — with a
  recommended option first. This includes **yes/no confirmations** (e.g. "can I
  mark `[x]` and close the sub-issue?"): pair them with an `AskUserQuestion`
  offering `Sim` / `Não` (recommended first), never plain prose. It makes
  answering a one-tap choice.
- Do not advance to the next step without explicit user approval.
- Implement one subtask at a time; never expand scope mid-subtask.
- Keep every artifact short — each step fits on one terminal screen.

Limits and settings live in `pscode/config.yaml`.
